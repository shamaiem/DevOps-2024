## [1. WASM vs Container Technologies](https://shamaiem.medium.com/wasm-vs-container-technologies-fab9f0132c47)
This blog compares WebAssembly (WASM) and container technologies, highlighting their similarities, differences, and unique use cases. 

### Key Points:
- **Containers**:
  - Containers package applications and their dependencies to ensure portability across environments.
  - Popular technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift.
  - Key features include isolation, portability, efficiency, and standardization.

- **WebAssembly (WASM)**:
  - WASM is a binary instruction format designed for running high-performance applications in browsers and beyond.
  - Features include speed, portability, security (sandboxing), and compact binaries.
  - Expanding use cases from web applications to server-side and cloud computing.

- **Similarities**:
  - Both emphasize portability and efficiency.
  - Security through isolation (WASM via sandboxing, containers via OS-level isolation).

- **Differences**:
  - WASM excels in lightweight web-based environments and cross-platform execution.
  - Containers dominate cloud-native, multi-service architectures.

- **Future Outlook**:
  - Potential synergies between WASM and containers, leveraging their strengths for innovative solutions.

## [2. Running a Python Application Through WebAssembly (WASM)](https://shamaiem.medium.com/running-a-python-application-through-webassembly-wasm-a845af3eaccb)
This blog provides a step-by-step guide to running Python applications in a WebAssembly environment, showcasing how to leverage WASM's portability and performance benefits.

### Key Points:
- **Overview**:
  - WASM enables Python applications to run efficiently in web browsers or WASM runtimes without the need for installation.
  - Ideal for scenarios requiring portability and lightweight environments.

- **Steps to Run Python on WASM**:
  1. **Install Emscripten**: The toolchain required to compile Python code to WASM.
  2. **Set Up a WASM-Compatible Python Environment**: Using tools like Pyodide.
  3. **Write Python Code**: Create a basic Python script for testing.
  4. **Compile to WASM**: Convert the Python code to a WASM binary using the toolchain.
  5. **Test in a Web Browser**: Use an HTML file to load and run the WASM file.
  6. **Enhance with Interactivity**: Integrate JavaScript for dynamic interactions.

- **Advantages**:
  - Portability across platforms.
  - No need for installing Python locally.
  - Fast execution due to WASM's binary format.

- **Challenges**:
  - Limited support for some Python libraries.
  - Requires familiarity with compiling to WASM.

- **Conclusion**:
  - WASM presents a promising future for Python applications, making them more accessible and efficient in web-based environments.
